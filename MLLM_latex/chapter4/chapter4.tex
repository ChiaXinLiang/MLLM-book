\chapterauthor{Wei An}


Training Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is a complex process that typically involves a combination of large-scale pre-training and task-specific fine-tuning. In this chapter, we will explore the various strategies employed during the pre-training phase, the importance of fine-tuning for specific tasks, and the role of advanced techniques such as few-shot and zero-shot learning. Additionally, we will delve into instruction tuning, a recent approach that enhances MLLMs' ability to follow human-like instructions across multiple modalities.

\section{Pre-Training Strategies}

Pre-training forms the foundation of MLLMs. It involves training the model on vast multimodal datasets, typically consisting of paired text and image data. The goal of pre-training is to provide the model with a general understanding of language and visual representations that can later be adapted to specific tasks.

\subsection{Contrastive Learning (CLIP, ALIGN)}

Contrastive learning is a key method in training multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Here are some important methods and insights related to contrastive learning in this context:

\textbf{Basic Concept}: Contrastive learning involves training models to differentiate between similar and dissimilar pairs of data. In the case of MLLMs, this often means aligning text and image pairs while distinguishing them from mismatched pairs. This approach helps in creating shared embedding spaces for different modalities, which is crucial for tasks like cross-modal retrieval \cite{cite4}.

\textbf{Hallucination Augmented Contrastive Learning}: This method introduces the concept of hallucination, where additional synthetic data points are generated to enhance the contrastive learning process. This approach aims to improve the model's robustness and generalization capabilities, especially in zero-shot scenarios where the model needs to perform tasks it hasn't been explicitly trained on \cite{cite1, cite2}.

\textbf{Img-Diff: Contrastive Data Synthesis}: This technique involves creating a novel dataset that enhances the quality of contrastive learning by synthesizing new data points. The Img-Diff dataset, for instance, focuses on improving the quality of multimodal data, which is essential for the effective training of high-performance MLLMs \cite{cite3}.

\textbf{Integration with Other Techniques}: Contrastive learning is often combined with other methods like masked language modeling and visual question answering to enhance the model's understanding of multimodal data. This integration helps in building robust models that can handle a wide range of tasks across different modalities \cite{cite4}.

These methods highlight the innovative approaches being used to enhance the capabilities of MLLMs through contrastive learning, ensuring they can effectively process and understand both text and visual information.

CLIP, developed by OpenAI, utilizes a contrastive learning method where the model learns to associate images with their corresponding text descriptions while distinguishing them from unrelated pairs. This approach allows CLIP to perform zero-shot learning, enabling it to generalize to tasks it wasn't explicitly trained on, such as recognizing objects in images without having seen labeled examples of those objects during training.

Similarly, ALIGN, developed by Google, aligns images and text by learning joint embeddings from large-scale noisy data. ALIGN is designed to handle massive datasets and is robust to noise in the training data, making it highly scalable. Like CLIP, ALIGN also demonstrates strong zero-shot performance, enabling it to perform well on a variety of tasks without specific task-based training.

Both CLIP and ALIGN exemplify the power of contrastive learning in multimodal AI systems, effectively bridging the gap between textual and visual data through shared embedding spaces.


\subsection{Masked Language Modeling (MLM) in Multimodal Large Language Models}

Masked Language Modeling (MLM) is a traditional technique where the model is trained to predict missing words in a sentence using the surrounding context. In Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), this technique is extended to \textbf{multimodal masked modeling}, where the model must predict masked words and image regions, forcing it to learn joint representations of text and images \cite{ComprehensiveSurvey2024}.

MLLMs employing MLM techniques are used in various applications, including object-centric robotic manipulation, where the model predicts the precise end-effector pose by understanding both the textual instructions and the visual context. This capability is crucial for developing embodied AI systems that can interact with and manipulate their environment effectively \cite{ManipLLM2024}.

The training of MLLMs often involves a combination of image-text contrastive learning, image-text matching, and masked language modeling. These tasks collectively help the model to align visual and textual modalities, improving its performance in tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, and more complex multimodal interactions \cite{OverviewLMM2024}.

Ongoing research in this area focuses on enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of MLLMs by refining the MLM techniques used, exploring new architectures, and integrating more diverse datasets. These efforts aim to create models that are not only more capable of understanding multimodal inputs but also more efficient in terms of computational resources \cite{ResearchDevelopment2023}.



\subsection{Visual Question Answering (VQA) Pre-training}

Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a crucial task in the realm of multimodal models, where models are pre-trained on tasks such as VQA or image captioning. In this scenario, the model is exposed to paired questions and images, requiring it to learn how to infer relationships between text and visual content. This approach often leverages cross-attention mechanisms to align the two modalities effectively \cite{MaskedVisionLanguage2023}.

Recent advancements in VQA pre-training have shown significant success, particularly in specialized domains such as medical imaging. These models are trained using both unimodal and multimodal contrastive losses, enhancing their ability to understand complex visual and textual interactions. The use of retrieval-augmented methods has further improved the performance of VQA systems by incorporating additional contextual information from large datasets \cite{RAMMBiomedicalVQA2023}.

However, challenges remain due to the limited availability of diverse multimodal datasets, especially in niche areas like medical VQA. This scarcity necessitates innovative approaches to data augmentation and transfer learning to ensure robust model performance across various applications \cite{MedicalVQA2023}.

Ongoing research focuses on refining these pre-training techniques and expanding the dataset availability to improve the versatility and accuracy of VQA models in different contexts \cite{pengfeiliHEU2023}.


\subsection{Vision-and-Language Pretraining (VLP)}

\textbf{Vision-and-Language Pretraining (VLP)} strategies are crucial for developing robust multimodal models. These strategies involve pre-training on diverse tasks such as image-text matching, masked language modeling, and next-sentence prediction, all within a multimodal context. By engaging in multiple tasks simultaneously, the model gains a comprehensive understanding of the interactions between language and vision, enabling it to perform complex reasoning tasks \cite{VisoAI2024}.

Models like UNITER, ViLBERT, and OSCAR are prime examples of this multitask approach, which enhances multimodal reasoning by integrating cross-modal fusions within a dual-encoder architecture. This architecture allows the models to effectively process and align visual and textual data, improving their performance across various multimodal tasks \cite{FlexibleVLP2023}.

Moreover, recent advancements in VLP strategies have addressed challenges related to heterogeneity in federated learning environments, particularly in specialized domains such as biomedical applications. These improvements have been instrumental in refining the flexibility and adaptability of VLP models, making them more efficient in handling diverse datasets and tasks \cite{HeterogeneityFederatedVLP2024}.

Ongoing research continues to explore innovative pretraining strategies, aiming to further enhance the capabilities and efficiency of VLP models in understanding and reasoning about multimodal data \cite{FeedbackModalSearch2024}.



\section{Fine-Tuning for Specific Tasks}

After pre-training, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are typically fine-tuned on specific tasks to maximize their performance in particular domains. Fine-tuning is an essential process that adapts the general knowledge gained during pre-training to the nuances of a specific task, ensuring that the model can deliver more accurate and relevant results \cite{TenyksBlogger2024}.

This process involves adjusting the model's parameters using task-specific data, which helps in aligning the model's capabilities with the requirements of the target application. Techniques such as task-specific instruction tuning and the use of multiway adapters have been developed to make fine-tuning more efficient and less resource-intensive \cite{EfficientMLLMs2024}. 

Moreover, fine-tuning allows MLLMs to leverage their multimodal understanding, enhancing their ability to process and integrate information from different modalities, such as text and images, which is particularly beneficial in complex tasks \cite{MultiwayAdapter2024}.

Ongoing research aims to further streamline fine-tuning processes, reducing the computational costs and improving the adaptability of MLLMs to a wider range of tasks and domains \cite{RobustInstructionTuning2024}.



\subsection{Task-Specific Datasets}

Fine-tuning involves training on task-specific datasets. For example, to fine-tune a model for image captioning, a dataset with aligned image-caption pairs such as MS COCO is used. For tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA), the model is trained on datasets like VQA 2.0, where it learns to answer natural language questions based on the content of an image.

\subsection{Learning Rate Scheduling and Optimization}

Fine-tuning typically requires adjusting the learning rate, with smaller learning rates often being used compared to the pre-training phase. This ensures that the model doesn’t forget the general knowledge it gained during pre-training but instead refines it for the specific task. Popular optimization techniques like AdamW are commonly used.

\subsection{Multitask Fine-Tuning}

In some cases, models are fine-tuned on multiple tasks simultaneously, a technique known as \textbf{multitask learning}. This helps the model generalize better across various related tasks. For example, a model might be fine-tuned on both image captioning and visual question answering datasets simultaneously, allowing it to perform well in both scenarios.

\subsection{Cross-Modal Tasks}

Fine-tuning is essential for tasks that require the model to reason across modalities, such as cross-modal retrieval or referring expression comprehension (where the model must identify specific objects in an image based on a text description). The goal is to align the visual and textual representations effectively during this phase.

\subsection{Cross-Modal Tasks}

Fine-tuning is essential for tasks that require the model to reason across modalities, such as cross-modal retrieval or referring expression comprehension, where the model must identify specific objects in an image based on a text description. The goal during this phase is to effectively align the visual and textual representations \cite{CrossModalTasks2024}.

\section{Few-Shot and Zero-Shot Learning in MLLMs}

Few-shot and zero-shot learning have become powerful capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), allowing them to generalize to new tasks with little to no task-specific data. This is particularly valuable when labeled datasets are scarce or expensive to curate \cite{FewShotZeroShotLearning2024}.

\subsection{Few-Shot Learning}

In \textbf{few-shot learning}, the model is fine-tuned on a small number of examples for a new task. For MLLMs, this means that after pre-training, the model can quickly adapt to new tasks by observing just a handful of image-text pairs or task examples. Few-shot learning is especially useful for niche tasks where only a limited amount of data is available \cite{FewShotLearning2024}.

\subsection{Zero-Shot Learning}

\textbf{Zero-shot learning} refers to the ability of a model to perform tasks without having seen any examples of that task during training. MLLMs like CLIP are trained to generalize across tasks and domains by learning from a large variety of text-image pairs. As a result, CLIP can perform zero-shot image classification, where it assigns labels to images it has never seen before, simply by leveraging its understanding of the text and image relationships learned during pre-training \cite{ZeroShotLearning2024}.

\subsection{Transfer Learning}

Few-shot and zero-shot learning are made possible by \textbf{transfer learning}, where knowledge gained from pre-training on one set of tasks is transferred to new, unseen tasks. This is particularly effective in MLLMs because they are trained on large, diverse multimodal datasets that cover a wide range of text and visual domains, allowing for strong generalization across tasks \cite{TransferLearning2024}.

\section{Instruction Tuning for MLLMs}

Instruction tuning is a newer technique that enhances the ability of MLLMs to follow human instructions across modalities. It involves fine-tuning the model using explicit instructions in natural language, enabling the model to perform a broader range of tasks with greater flexibility and accuracy \cite{InstructionTuning2024}.

\subsection{Natural Language Instructions}

Instruction tuning uses datasets where tasks are framed as natural language instructions. For instance, instead of providing just an image and asking the model to generate a caption, the model is given a prompt like, \textit{"Describe the image in detail."} This allows the model to understand human-like instructions and follow them more closely \cite{NaturalLanguageInstructions2024}.

\subsection{Multimodal Instruction Tuning}

Instruction tuning can also be applied to multimodal tasks. In this case, the model is trained to follow multimodal prompts that involve both text and images. For example, a task might include an image and the instruction, \textit{"What is the person in the image doing?"} This helps the model learn to follow complex, human-like commands that span multiple modalities \cite{MultimodalInstructionTuning2024}.


\subsection{Improving Generalization}

Instruction tuning is designed to improve the model’s generalization abilities. By training the model to interpret instructions in natural language, it becomes more flexible in handling new tasks without needing extensive retraining. This technique can also be combined with few-shot and zero-shot learning, further enhancing the model’s ability to generalize across tasks with minimal additional data.

\subsection{Applications of Instruction Tuning}

Instruction-tuned MLLMs are particularly useful in interactive AI systems, where users provide instructions in natural language and expect the AI to perform a task based on those instructions. This has broad applications in personal assistants, customer service bots, and even creative tasks like generating art or stories based on user prompts.

Instruction-tuned models enhance the capabilities of personal assistants by allowing them to understand and execute complex user instructions. This includes managing schedules, setting reminders, and even controlling smart home devices through natural language commands \cite{LarkSuite}.

In customer service, instruction-tuned models can handle a wide range of queries by understanding and responding to customer instructions with high accuracy \cite{OpenAICommunity}.

Instruction-tuned models are also valuable in creative domains, such as generating art, stories, or music based on user prompts \cite{RohitAggarwal}.

These models can be used in educational tools to provide personalized learning experiences \cite{RedditExperience}.

In software development, instruction-tuned models can assist in code generation and debugging by following developer instructions \cite{RohitAggarwal}.
