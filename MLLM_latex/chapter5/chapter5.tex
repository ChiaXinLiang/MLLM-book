\section{Image Captioning and VQA}
The integration of computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) has led to remarkable advancements in tasks like \textbf{Image Captioning} and \textbf{Visual Question Answering (VQA)}. Both fields aim to generate rich textual interpretations of visual data, requiring a deep understanding of visual elements and linguistic relationships. Historically, early models relied on hand-crafted features, but modern systems, particularly with the rise of \textbf{Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)}, have revolutionized the performance and scope of these applications. Leveraging vast datasets and sophisticated architectures, MLLMs now generate captions and answer questions about images with unprecedented accuracy, making them integral to several real-world applications.

This paper surveys the progress of MLLMs in both image captioning and VQA, illustrating their technical underpinnings and applications.

\subsection{Image Captioning: Overview and Advances}
Image captioning refers to automatically generating textual descriptions for images by combining visual and linguistic processing. Early methods were limited to hand-crafted rules, but modern deep learning approaches, particularly through MLLMs, have dramatically improved performance. By training on large image-text datasets like MSCOCO and Flickr, MLLMs can generate rich and contextually accurate captions, significantly outperforming older methods \cite{icmeta2020m2transformer, icmeta2019oscar, icmeta2020densecap}.

Key advancements include techniques like:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{OSCAR (Object-Semantics Aligned Pre-training)}: Enhances captioning by aligning object tags with textual descriptions during pre-training. This leads to better object recognition and semantically rich captions \cite{icmeta2019oscar}.
    \item \textbf{VIVO (Visual Vocabulary Pre-training)}: Introduces a vocabulary of visual concepts, allowing models to caption novel objects unseen during training, crucial for real-world applications \cite{icmeta2019vivo}.
    \item \textbf{Dense Captioning}: A novel approach that generates region-specific captions for different parts of an image, useful in detailed image understanding and retrieval \cite{icmeta2020densecap}.
    \item \textbf{Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)}: Applied to refine caption fluency and coherence by leveraging adversarial training \cite{icmeta2021gan}.
    \item \textbf{Meta-Learning Approaches}: Enable MLLMs to quickly adapt to new tasks with minimal data, improving generalization across various tasks, especially when training data is scarce \cite{icmeta2019meta}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Visual Question Answering (VQA): Overview and Advances}
VQA is an interdisciplinary field requiring a system to generate accurate answers to questions posed about images, combining both visual and textual reasoning \cite{vqa_survey2023}. Unlike image captioning, which describes an image holistically, VQA focuses on specific queries about an image's content.

MLLMs have made significant strides in VQA tasks by utilizing the same underlying multimodal architectures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{MCAN (Multimodal Co-Attention Network)}: Uses co-attention mechanisms to fuse image and text features, resulting in improved understanding of image-question relationships \cite{mcan_vqa2019}.
    \item \textbf{Knowledge-Enhanced VQA Models}: Incorporate external knowledge graphs for commonsense reasoning, improving performance on complex VQA tasks \cite{lan2023improvingzeroshotvisualquestion}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Applications of Image Captioning and VQA}

The advancements in MLLMs have expanded their applications across diverse domains, offering solutions to various real-world problems by bridging the gap between visual data and language.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Assistive Technologies} Both image captioning and VQA play critical roles in assistive technologies for the visually impaired. Image captioning systems convert visual scenes into real-time audio descriptions, helping users interpret their surroundings. For instance, applications like Microsoft Seeing AI use MLLM-generated captions to describe objects, people, and text in a user's environment \cite{icmeta2021assistive}. VQA enhances this by allowing users to ask specific questions about their environment, such as "What is the name on the sign?" or "Is there anyone near me?" This interactivity elevates the autonomy of visually impaired individuals, enabling more tailored assistance \cite{assistive_vqa2020}.

MLLMs generate captions describing road conditions, obstacles, pedestrians, and traffic signs, improving the vehicle's situational awareness \cite{icmeta2020autonomous}. VQA complements this by enabling the system to answer real-time queries like "Is there a stop sign ahead?" or "What is the speed limit?" enhancing the vehicle's capacity to navigate complex environments safely \cite{autonomous_vqa2019}.
    
    \item \textbf{Medical Imaging and Healthcare:} In medical imaging, MLLM-based captioning systems automatically generate diagnostic reports by interpreting X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs. This reduces the workload on radiologists and ensures faster report generation with high accuracy. Tools like CaptionHealth utilize these techniques to assist in real-time diagnostics \cite{icmeta2021medical}. VQA models enable clinicians to query specific aspects of medical images, such as "What abnormalities are present?" or "Is there evidence of pneumonia?" This leads to more interactive and accessible healthcare diagnostics, aiding in rapid decision-making \cite{med_vqa2019, healthcare_vqa2021}.
    
    \item \textbf{Content Moderation and Search Engines:} On social media platforms, MLLMs are used to generate captions that automatically tag images and flag inappropriate content, making content moderation more efficient. Platforms like Facebook and Instagram employ image captioning tools to scale moderation efforts by identifying objectionable or dangerous content from uploaded images \cite{icmeta2020content}. VQA further enhances content moderation by allowing moderators to query images directly, asking questions such as "Does this image contain violence?" or "Is there inappropriate text in the background?" This interactive capability allows for more nuanced and scalable moderation systems \cite{moderation_vqa2021}.
\end{itemize}


Multimodal Large Language Models have revolutionized the fields of image captioning and VQA, providing sophisticated tools that understand and interpret complex visual information through text. From assistive technologies to autonomous systems, healthcare to content moderation, the applications of MLLMs continue to grow, promising a future where machines can interpret and respond to visual data with human-like comprehension.

\section{Visual Storytelling and Scene Understanding}

\subsection{Introduction}

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have profoundly impacted how AI handles tasks involving both visual and textual information. These models merge visual inputs with language processing, enabling systems to comprehend complex scenes and generate coherent narratives. This ability is especially crucial in fields like autonomous driving, interactive media, 3D modeling, and human-computer interaction \cite{vs2024li,vs2020hong}. This survey reviews recent advancements in visual storytelling and scene understanding, focusing on how MLLMs integrate visual and textual information to enable richer semantic understanding and narrative generation.

\subsection{Technologies for Visual Storytelling and Scene Understanding}

Visual storytelling, defined as generating coherent narratives from sequences of images or videos, has evolved from simpler object recognition methods to more sophisticated models that combine both visual semantics and contextual information. Early models often used scene graphs to capture relationships between objects but struggled with narrative coherence. The introduction of MLLMs has allowed for a more detailed interpretation of these relationships, integrating semantic layers for more nuanced storytelling.

For instance, the \textit{Multidimensional Semantic Augmented Network} provides a method for merging scene, object, and action semantics, enabling richer narrative construction \cite{vs2024li}. These models go beyond the static understanding of objects and scenes, instead focusing on how individual elements interact over time to form cohesive stories \cite{vs2024li}. In another example, \textit{Kosmos-1} leverages cross-modal knowledge transfer between vision and language, resulting in stories that are not only descriptive but also contextually relevant \cite{vs2024song}. By drawing on both visual and textual data, these models enable more fluent and complex storytelling compared to earlier systems.

Scene understanding, another key task, involves comprehending the spatial and relational structure of objects within a scene. Advanced models like \textit{Scene-LLM} integrate 3D visual data with textual descriptions, allowing for high-level reasoning about spatial relationships and object interactions. The use of hybrid 3D feature representations, which combine both global scene-level information and local object-centric details, enables models to reason about dynamic environments effectively \cite{vs2024rao}. This is particularly important in real-time applications, such as robotics and autonomous driving, where accurate scene understanding is critical to decision-making.

The growing availability of multimodal data, such as images, text, audio, and video, has made cross-modal retrieval a significant research area. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown exceptional capability in addressing the complexities of cross-modal retrieval by understanding and relating different modalities. This section explores the technologies, methodologies, and applications of MLLMs in cross-modal retrieval and search, emphasizing recent advancements.

\subsection{Technological Foundations of Cross-Modal Retrieval}

MLLMs rely on a combination of multimodal transformers dual-encoder architectures, and self-supervised learning to manage the relationships between different types of data. For instance, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP and DALL-E have demonstrated their ability to map images to descriptive text, and vice versa, enabling efficient cross-modal retrieval. These models use contrastive learning to align visual and textual representations in a shared semantic space \cite{vs2024li,vs2015ranjan}. Other architectures, such as cross-attention mechanisms, help in precisely understanding the relationships between elements of different modalities.

Generative models like GPT-4V extend this capability by generating relevant outputs in one modality based on inputs from another. These models use large multimodal datasets to learn intricate correlations between visual, textual, and auditory data, enabling more nuanced retrieval results \cite{vs2024gomez}. 

\subsection{Applications of MLLMs in Cross-Modal Retrieval and Search}
